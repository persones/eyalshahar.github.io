    description: An exhibit exhibit demonstating how computers on ships communicate
      with eachother over a protocol called <em<AIS (Automatic Identification
      System)</em>, The exhibit has a radio receiver, a BeagleBone computer, and
      two LCD displays, showing digital information as decoded by the receiver
      in AIS format, and then in human readable form as decoded by the
      BeagleBone. A byproduct of this project is <em>ExploAIS</em>, an
      open-source library for decoding AIS communication
